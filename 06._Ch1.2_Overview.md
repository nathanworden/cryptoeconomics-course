- a blockchain at a particular block
- a chess board after a player makes a move

### State Transition Funciton

What is a state transition function?

- A set of rules that determines how to transition the state from one configuration to another

Examples of state transition functions:

- The laws of physics
- the rules of a blockchain protocol

### Overview of PayPal structure

The state object which is a mapping of address -> balance

There are two types of state mutations (each with their own logic)

1. `mint`
2. `send`

We start with an initial state (ie `genesis block`). We then receive transactions, and based on our state stransition function reject invalid transactions and process valid transactions (ie create `blocks`). We then store the history of all transactions in a big ledger (ie a `blockchain`). Everyone's current accounts and balances is the current state (ie the latest `block`).

- The list of transactions (`blocks`) is called the "history"
- The result of computing all the transactions in the history leads to the current "state"
- In Ethereum the full history is approximately 250 GB, while the state is approximatley 3 GB.
