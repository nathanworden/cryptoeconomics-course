### Testing

Testing is a very important part of programming. Good testing will make you better.

To make sure that your code actually does what you think it does, try going through `demo.js` and filling out the story with the functions you just created. Doing so will not only allow you to check that your code is working correctlly, but also let you see exactly what's happening via the console. When you're ready run `node demo.js` in the directory for this section (1.1) to see the functions you're creating come to life!
