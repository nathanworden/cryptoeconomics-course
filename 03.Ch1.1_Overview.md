What is a cryptographic hash?

- Data(preimage) => hash function => unique output(hash)

Preimage Resistance:

- Given the output of a hash function (hash) you cannot determine the input data to the that hash function (preimage)

2nd Preimage Resistance (aka Collision Resistance):

- A hash cannot have more than 1 preimage - each piece of data produces a unique hash

Random Oracle:

- A hash has no statistical correlation to the input data that created it (aka it looks like random data)

### Cryptographic Signatures

What is a cryptographic signature?

- A mathmatical way to prove that a singer signed something

Public / Private Keys:

- Public key is like an addres / username
- Private key is like a password / signature

Signature Functions:

- Allows you to sign stuff with your keys
- This also allows other people to verify that you did or did not sign something.

Verification Functions:

- If you have a hash you can check that against a message (data), message signature, and public key of the signer to determine if that key signed that message. This is used to prove that X person signed Y document. If someone tries to change the document or the signature, the hash will be completely different.
