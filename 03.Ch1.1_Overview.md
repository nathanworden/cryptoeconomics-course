What is a cryptographic hash?

- Data(preimage) => hash function => unique output(hash)

Preimage Resistance:

- Given the output of a hash function (hash) you cannot determine the input data to the that hash function (preimage)

2nd Preimage Resistance (aka Collision Resistance):

- A hash cannot have more than 1 preimage - each piece of data produces a unique hash

Random Oracle:

- A hash has no statistical correlation to the input data that created it (aka it looks like random data)

### Cryptographic Signatures

What is a cryptographic signature?

- A mathmatical way to prove that a singer signed something

Public / Private Keys:

- Public key is like an addres / username
- Private key is like a password / signature

Signature Functions:

- Allows you to sign stuff with your keys
- This also allows other people to verify that you did or did not sign something.

Verification Functions:

- If you have a hash you can check that against a message (data), message signature, and public key of the signer to determine if that key signed that message. This is used to prove that X person signed Y document. If someone tries to change the document or the signature, the hash will be completely different.

Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hatches. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.

The ideal cryptographic hash function has the following main properties:

- It is deterministic, meaning that the same message always results in the same hash
- It is quick to compute the hash value for any given message
- It is infeasible to generate a message that yields a given hash value (i.e. to reverse the process that generated the given hash value)
- It is infeasibe to find two different messages with the same hash value
