## Chapter 1 Overview

Nonces - the number of transactions that everyone has sent.

0x means it's hexadecimal: numeral system made up of 16 symbols.

The symbols:  1-10, a, b, c, d,e, f

Meaning, hexadecimal is base 16.

### 1.1 Hashes and Signatures

- Two important cryptographic primitives
- Hash Functions
  - You have some input, you put it into a hash, and you get some output
- md5() - found a collision, so we don't use that one any more
- sha256() - good
- preimage
- The hash of our preimage has some kind of result
- There are four different properties of hash functions
  - preimage resistance - give the output of the hash function, we cannot determine the preimage. 
  - 2nd preimage resistace - given a particular preimage, we cannot find another preimage which has the same hash output.
  - Collision resistance - You can't find two different values which hash to equal the same thing, no matter what those values are.
  - Random Oracle - The output of a hash function is identical to a random number (the output of a random number generator). What that means is we can use the hash function as a source of randomness.
- Everyone knows your public key, only you know your private key
  - Public Key - identifer used to check signature
  - Private Key - secret used to sign messages (kind of like a password)
- There are three important functions for signatures
  - `generagte_keys()`
  - `sign()`
  - `verify()`

```javascript
generage_keys() {
  return (priv_key, pub_key)
}
```

```javascript
sign(message, priv_key) {
  return signature
}
```

```javascript
verify(message, pub_key, sig) {
  return True / False
}
```
