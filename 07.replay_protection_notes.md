## 1.3 Replay Protection

Protecting against undsired resubmission of transactions

The way we currently protect against replay protection is the nonce.

The nonce identifies what the transaction ordering should be for a particular sender.

"The nonce enforeces transaction ordering"

The nonce tells us which transaction came first.

#### Key Takeaway

Be aware of people using signed messages for unintended, somtimes malicious purposes.



### 1.3 Overview

#### Replay Protection

What is replay protection?

- Making sure that a transaction can only be processed once (no double spends!)

What is a nonce?

- A nonce is a number that is unique to every Ethereum account and attached to every transaction from that account. This number is incremented with every new transaction.

Why are nonces important?

- Every transaction's signature is a hash of many things including the data of the transaction, the account nonce, and the account key. Thus every authentic transaction signature is unique and every unique transaction is recorded in the history. If someone tries to resend the same transaction twice, the signature will match another transaction in the history. According to the rules of Ethereum (the state transition function) this is invalid. Invalid transactions are not processed by the network. Because oall nodes on the network follow hte same rules, this works.

What if a node makes up their own rules?

- Then it wouldn't be an Ethereum node because Ethereum nodes all follow the Ethereum protocol (state transition function) which determines what is and is not valid
- If a node goes rogue and tries to process invalid transactions they would have a different state than the rest of the blockchain. This would make all theirfuture transactions and blocks different than the rest of the Ethereum nodes, and thus would be rejected by the blockcain.

What if the node really wants to do it anyways?

- This is called a fork. Because nodes receive rewards for processing blocks that other nodes deem valid, it is in everyone's interest to follow the same rules. Yay cryptoeconomics.

#### Making Sense of Ethereum Nonce(sense)

What is nonce?

Nonce can mean two things in Ethereum:

- Proof of work nonce: a meaningless value in a block that can be adjusted in order to try to satisfy the proof of work condition. This is the essence of mining. This makes satisfying "proof of work" hard computational work that depends on luck.
- Account nonce: a trnasaction counter in each account that prevents replay attacks. For example, a transaction sending 20 coins from A to B can be repeated over and over by B to cointinually drain A's balance.

Our problem is related to the latter nonce - the trnsaction counter. When making a trnsaction in Ethereum, a consecutive number should be attached to each transaction on the same account. Each node will process transactions from a specific account in a strict order according to the avlue of its nonce.

Therefore, failing to increment this value correctly can result in different kinds of errors. For instance, let's say the latest transaction nonce was 121:

- Resuing nonce: if we send a new transaction for the same account with a nonce of either 121 or below, the node will reject it.
- "Gaps": if we send a new transaction with a nonce of either 123 or higher, the transaction will not be processed until this gap is closed, i.e. until a transaction with nonce 122 has been processed.

## Determining nonce for transactions

As mentioned earlier, we noticed that we were sending transactions that have the same nonce. To explain how this happened, let's first understand how we increment the nonce value in our mobile SKDs. We are using the Geth mobile method (EthereumClient.getPendingNonceAt) that takes the public address of an account as a paramenter. This method is eventually mapped to the `etc_getTransactionCount` JSON-RPC API method with a block parameter of "pending". Remember , a nonce is the transaction count in this context.

A pending block is the current block that a mode is mining, which has yet to be confirmed and propagaged through the blockchain network. Blocks are limited in size, so when a pending block is full, any other transactions that arrive to the node are kept in a special area of the node memory, also known as the transaction pool or txpool.

`etc_getTransactionCount` with a 'pending' parameter takes the latest nonce from the last mined block and adds transactions residing in the pending block, while ignoring any transactions that might stand waiting in the `txpool`.

No it became clear to us what had caused the problem - we encountered a peak in the Ethereum test network. Our transactions were queued in `txpool`, and we weren't able to enter the pending block for a long time. Because the node only considered existing mined blocks and the pending block, querying a node for transaction count to get the next nonce returned the same nonce we already used. This resulted in multiple transactions with the same nonce, as long as our transactions didn't pass `txpol` and proceeded to the pending block. Eventually, when our trnsactions progressed in the `txpool` 	ueue and were processed, they were rejected because they used the same nonce.
